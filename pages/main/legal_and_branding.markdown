OpenMAMA Compliance and Certification Program
---------------------------------------------

The OpenMAMA project aspires to two major goals through its compliance program:

First, the compliance program ensures that products, services or organizations that want to use the OpenMAMA trademark meet specific criteria including compatibility with other OpenMAMA products and services, conformance with best practices for OpenMAMA API usage, quality, and robustness.

Second, the compliance program endeavors to provide tools, documentation and other resources to assist participants in the OpenMAMA community in improving OpenMAMA and building the best possible products and services with and around OpenMAMA.

Trademark Requirements
----------------------

-   Conform to the practices and standards outlined in the OpenMAMA Self Certification document prepared by the OpenMAMA Maintainer and approved by the OpenMAMA Steering Committee.
    -   NOTE: this document will be available some time after the official launch of OpenMAMA when the steering committee is in place.
-   Pass a code certification test prepared by the Maintainer and approved by the Steering Committee to verify conformance.
-   Pass automated tests prepared by the Maintainer and approved by the Steering Committee that verify correct API usage.
-   If applicable, pass an integration suite test prepared by the Maintainer and approved by the Steering Committee establishing that the application coexists and interacts with other certified applications and components;
-   Additionally Middleware and Payload Bridges must:
    -   Pass a test suite prepared by the Maintainer and approved by the Steering Committee demonstrating that all functionality is implemented correctly.
    -   Pass an integration suite test prepared by the Maintainer and approved by the Steering Committee establishing that applications and components are:
        -   Compatible with the middleware and/or payload bridge specified by the Linux Foundation.
        -   Possess the ability for new payload or middleware to be substituted for any supported payload or middleware. Support multiple bridges in a single application.

The tests and validation required for certification will be conducted by a body approved by the Linux Foundation.

As we launch OpenMAMA, the compliance program is a work in progress. More information will be posted here as the Maintainer and Steering Committee members work out the details.

Trademark Usage
---------------

OpenMAMA is a trademark of [The Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/).  Any product that will use the OpenMAMA trademark and logo must demonstrate that it is compliant with the OpenMAMA specification and being used in accordance with the [Linux Foundation Trademark Policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/linux-foundation-trademark-usage-guidelines).  Approval is granted for a specific product and for the specific version and release of OpenMAMA.

The OpenMAMA trademark policy is linked with compliance to provide a clear indicator of compatibility between releases, product, and applications. This enables the OpenMAMA name and trademark to clearly and consistently communicate what is and what is not compliant with OpenMAMA in the marketplace.

Although the OpenMAMA Project has no intention of restricting your rights to use, modify or distribute code licensed under open source licenses, all requirements of the OpenMAMA Compliance Program must be fulfilled in order to use the OpenMAMA trademark in association with your product.

Guidelines for Websites
-----------------------

The OpenMAMA website guidelines are in place to clearly differentiate official OpenMAMA sites. We encourage community sites. However, if you are going to create a website about OpenMAMA and plan to use the word "OpenMAMA" in the site name or URL, or plan to use the OpenMAMA logo, you must adhere to these simple guidelines.

-   Do not represent your site as an "official" OpenMAMA website.
-   You must have the following disclaimer on every page (in the footer is fine):
    -   *"OpenMAMA and all related marks and logos are registered trademarks of The Linux Foundation. This website is not, in any way, endorsed by the [OpenMAMA Project]({{ site.url }}) or [The Linux Foundation.](http://linuxfoundation.org/)"*
-   You must use official icons if using the OpenMAMA logo.
-   You must not modify the OpenMAMA logo. It has a very specific meaning and purpose related to compliance.
-   Before registering a domain name that includes the text "OpenMAMA", you must request permission by emailing <trademarks@linuxfoundation.org>.

Ensuring Proper Use of the OpenMAMA Trademark
---------------------------------------------

Because the OpenMAMA trademark is closely tied to the compliance program, it is very important that it be used correctly and appropriately. Unfortunately cases do arise where the OpenMAMA mark is used incorrectly or out of context. If you believe a use of the OpenMAMA mark to be questionable or causing confusion, please email <trademarks@linuxfoundation.org>. We will evaluate the use and, if necessary, will attempt to reach the owner of the questionable content with specific corrections and a deadline to become compliant. If there is no positive reply, a legal counsel will follow up. 

The intention of this process is to ensure that a content owner who is acting in good faith but is genuinely unaware of the guidelines can be properly informed and have an opportunity to make corrections, prior to any legal intervention.
