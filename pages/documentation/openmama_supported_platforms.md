## Support Lifecycle

As OpenMAMA develops alongside infrastructures, the **project aims to support platforms for as long as production support is widely available from it's providers**. An example of this would be that of RHEL's first three [production phases](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata), during which OpenMAMA will be supported.

## Linux

- CentOS / RHEL 6 (x64)
- CentOS / RHEL 7 (x64)
- CentOS / RHEL 8 (x64)
- Fedora 31 (x64)
- Fedora 32 (x64)
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (x64)
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (x64)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (x64)

Although not strictly supported, OpenMAMA will most likely run fine on other Linux distros.
As long as OpenMAMA's [dependancies](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/wiki/Building-on-Linux#dependencies) have been installed OpenMAMA should build and run.

## Windows
Currently, the following Windows versions are supported:

- Windows 8 (x86 / x64)
- Windows 10 (x86 / x64)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (x86 / x64)
- Windows Server 2012 (x86 / x64)
- Windows Server 2012 R2 (x86 / x64)
