The portable demo environment is effectively an out of the box sandbox which contains a working
OpenMAMA installation and configuration as well as a market data publisher constantly running
locally using qpid. It is designed to let you get up and running with an OpenMAMA development
environment with zero fuss by allowing you to use our existing AMI or even our vagrant box
which you can then remote develop on using an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

It also contains an upstream connection to the OpenMAMA cloudsmith repositories for streamlined
upgrades to the latest versions of OpenMAMA and a selection of any free and non-free plugins
which third parties have opted to host there.
