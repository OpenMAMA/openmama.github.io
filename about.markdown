Release plan and roadmap
Working with other open source projects on which OpenMAMA supported applications and solutions depend
Role of the OpenMAMA Software Maintainer
As in most open source projects, OpenMAMA will have a dedicated source code maintainer who, as the delegated authority, reviews patches that are submitted by contributors, provides feedback to the developers, and accepts the patches that are appropriate.

Responsibilities of the OpenMAMA Software Maintainer include:

Approve and develop roadmap based on suggestions from the Steering Committee
Work with the technical team to drive the technical direction of the OpenMAMA project
Scheduling work efforts based on prioritization of the Steering Committee and the needs of the project
Managing resources and their work items
Setting the criteria for accepted / rejected code
Reviewing submitted code / accept and reject based on pre-defined rules
Tracking dependency issues
Notifying developers of source code changes that may affect their packages
Managing source code security issues
Working closely with technical team developing the source code
Working closely with QA team testing the source code
Dealing with reported bugs in a timely manner
Preparing binaries – packages of the source code
OpenMAMA Working Groups
These groups define and document the various requirements for the OpenMAMA Project, which are formed around the strongest needs for the Project’s users. The Technical Group take these requirements and work with the Maintainer to develop plans that can then be executed along a roadmap.
