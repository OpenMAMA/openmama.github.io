What is the OpenMAMA project?
-----------------------------

OpenMAMA is an open source project hosted at the Linux Foundation. OpenMAMA provides a high performance Middleware Agnostic Messaging API that interfaces with a variety of message oriented middleware systems.

-   OpenMAMA allows developers to bring applications to market more easily and rapidly, within any industry-standard middleware environment, irrespective of the network infrastructure or underlying middleware.
-   Enables users to embrace new middleware technologies and applications as the market innovates.
-   Built for high performance both in terms of throughput and latency.
-   Provides a common API for messaging allowing freedom to differentiate at both the middleware and application level.
-   Provides functionality to facilitate rapid development of applications that produce and consume financial market data:
-   Data quality notifications including automatic sequence number checking and recap requests.
-   Point-to-point initial value requests.
-   Support for conflation.
-   Completely free and open source software licensed under LGPL version 2.
-   Follows open source development methods and processes.
-   Participation is open to any developer, corporation or entity.
-   Also applicable to other industry verticals: Has high potential for market penetration outside of the financial sector in other industries

Why is it important?
--------------------

-   OpenMAMA is a vendor neutral platform driven by those at the forefront of innovation in the financial services community.
-   OpenMAMA enables companies to protect their technology investments and remove the friction in implementing new trading technology solutions.
-   OpenMAMA removes vendor lock-in at middleware, payload and API levels. This enables users to embrace new middlewares and applications as the market innovates.
-   OpenMAMA becomes the standard open messaging API for financial services.
-   OpenMAMA helps organizations speed up their time-to-market for event driven applications and improves their messaging middleware technology.
-   OpenMAMA has high potential for market penetration outside of the financial sector, towards other sectors such as Telecommunication, High Performance Computing, Web Services and Logistics.

What are examples of solutions or services that can be implemented with OpenMAMA?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Market data vendors can publish data like quotes and trades and implement other services over an industry standard platform.
-   Middleware vendors can implement middleware and payload bridges to extend OpenMAMA's compatibility to new middlewares.
-   Market data application developers can write applications that publish and consume market data and provide novel functionality.
-   Value added services such as entitlements can be written on top of the OpenMAMA's platform.

Why is the project hosted at the Linux Foundation?
--------------------------------------------------

[The Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) provides a neutral home for the industry and the open source community to collaborate on OpenMAMA.

What does the Linux Foundation hope to achieve with the OpenMAMA Project?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project facilitates collaboration between various companies and open source developers to advance the implementation of an open source messaging platform. It is a one of a kind project, the first open standard and open source solution for the community.

How is OpenMAMA different from similar open source and commercial software?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today there is no common open source API that connects multiple middleware transports to applications across multiple development platforms. OpenMAMA, unlike many other messaging APIs, focuses on the requirement for high throughput and low latency messaging. OpenMAMA is open source and vendor neutral. It is backed by a community of users and developers from numerous financial institutions, market data vendors, and technology firms.

Why do companies use OpenMAMA? What are the technical advantages of adopting it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenMAMA offers an open standard that lowers cost and increases efficiency for all players. It prevents vendor lock-in and enables users to develop solutions without committing to a specific messaging platform. OpenMAMA is truly agnostic: you write your application once and it can be deployed on mulitiple messaging soulitons without any changes in the code or even recompiling. OpenMAMA is fast, scalable, supports multiple platforms and languages.

What are the economic benefits of OpenMAMA?
-------------------------------------------

Adopting OpenMAMA:

-   reduces time to market and removes friction for companies who rely on messaging infrastructures
-   allows companies that use multiple middlewares to develop their applications to a single standardized API
-   eliminates the need to "wrap the wrapper" to avoid vendor lock in
-   reduces time to market with a single messaging API and value added features

Under which open source license is OpenMAMA made available?
-----------------------------------------------------------

OpenMAMA is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1. You can view the full LGPLv2 license here: <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>

What were the motivations for choosing that specific license?
-------------------------------------------------------------

LGPLv2 is an open source license that is more permissive than GPL. It provides more flexibility for both the users and developers of the code. It enables businesses to use the code for commercial applications and in return these commercial applications contribute back to the open source making the code richer in functionality and better in quality for all. The commercial portion of applications that use OpenMAMA remain proprietary under the LGPLv2 while changes to the OpenMAMA API are open source.

What is the governance model of the project?
--------------------------------------------

The OpenMAMA project governance consists of a Steering Committee and a Technical Group.
