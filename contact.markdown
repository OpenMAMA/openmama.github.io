There are many ways to communicate within the OpenMAMA development community. If you have a question or an issue and aren't sure what to do, please use the following guide.

If in doubt, always start with the Gitter channel.
Gitter (Chat)
For an immediate response to a question, or to have a detailed discussion, please use Gitter.
General Guidelines for Gitter
Keep it clean: Many of us participate from work, so keep the language clean. Treat people with respect and consideration - no regional, racial, gender or other abuse will be tolerated
Be helpful: Be patient with new people and be willing to jump in to answer questions.
Stay calm: The written word is always subject to interpretation, so give people the benefit of the doubt and try not to let emotions get out of control.
Don't post chunks: Avoid posting big chunks of text.
Be Patient: Folks might not be around when you ask a question so wait a while for someone to speak before leaving.
Don't Private Message: Ask permission before you send someone a private message (PM) as not everyone likes them. Also by keeping it in public others with similar issues can see the solution you were given.

Guidelines for Participation
Our goal is to maintain an environment of professionalism, respect, and innovation within OpenMAMA development.

Please adhere to the following guidelines as you participate in the OpenMAMA project:
Be professional in all communications. Please avoid flaming, profanity, vulgarity, SHOUTING IN ALL CAPS. Keep personal discussion for live chat. There is never any reason to publicly discuss gender, ethnicity, orientation, lifestyle, or religion in our project.
Stay on topic. If you have a comment that is not relevant to the current discussion, please start a new thread.
Keep it legal. Please use project resources for their intended purpose.
Don't feed trolls. Every open project attracts unwelcome commentary from individuals trying to get a rise out of someone. When this happens, just ignore them.
Guideline Violations
The OpenMAMA project applies the "3 strikes" method, with the exception of obvious spammers, trolls, and abuse. Depending upon severity, these may be banned on the first occurrence and without warning.
Public reminder that the behavior is inappropriate.
Final warning that additional inappropriate actions will result in removal.
Banning for up to 6 months.
