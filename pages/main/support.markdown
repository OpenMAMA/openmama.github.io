### <i class='fa fa-clipboard'/> Guidelines for Participation

Our goal is to maintain an environment of professionalism, respect, and innovation within OpenMAMA development.

#### <i class='fas fa-user-check'/> Rules

Please adhere to the following guidelines as you participate in the OpenMAMA project:
* **Be professional.** Please avoid flaming, profanity, vulgarity, SHOUTING IN ALL CAPS. Keep personal discussion for
  live chat. There is never any reason to publicly discuss gender, ethnicity, orientation, lifestyle, or religion in our project.
* **Stay on topic.** If you have a comment that is not relevant to the current discussion, please start a new thread.
* **Keep it legal.** Please use project resources for their intended purpose and do not share code which is not yours to share.
* **Don't feed the trolls.** If you are getting trolled, ignore or report.
* **Be helpful.** Be patient with new people and be willing to jump in to answer questions.
* **Stay calm.** The written word is always subject to interpretation, so give people the benefit of the doubt and try
  not to let emotions get out of control.
* **Don't post chunks.** Avoid posting *big chunks* of text. Feel free to use [github gist](https://gist.github.com/) or
  similar if sharing code is necessary.
* **Be Patient.** Folks might not be around when you ask a question so wait a while for someone to speak before leaving.
* **Don't Private Message.** Ask permission before you send someone a private message as it can be considered rude and
  subsequently ignored. Others may want to see what you have to say anyway so don't be shy.

#### <i class='fa fa-gavel'/> Enforcement

Depending upon severity, these may be banned on the first occurrence and without warning.
